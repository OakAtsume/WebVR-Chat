<h1>WebVR Chat</h1>

<p> ㅤㅤWebVR Chat is a 3d/vr space to interact with one another! This project is inspiered by VRChat, but I dont intend to clone it, just make the consept of it web-friendly. My plan is to have it be able to run on moble, computer, and mayby VR headsets, though serious testing will be needed.:3</p>

<p> ㅤㅤSo far, I've been working hard on this project, and even got down a basic character controler that's applyed to world ID: 00002; wich is accessed by "Logging on" and goind to explore worlds bu the buttion of world ID: 00001.</p>

<h1>How To Use?</h1>

<p>ㅤㅤIt's easy, you can use </p>

`git clone https://github.com/funing36/WebVR-Chat.git`

<p>ㅤㅤOnce downloaded, some computers will allow you to run a local host directly from your computer, but most of the time, you'll need help to get it working. I would recomend using Github Codespaces or VSCode and have the extention "Live Server", then open up "/WebVRChat/index.html" and press go live on the bottom right.</p>

<p>Alternativly, you can just launch the game via this link: https://funing36.github.io/WebVR-Chat/WebVR%20Chat/. Loading the scene might take a while, depending on your internet speed.</p>



<h1>Why is it so buggy?</h1>

<p>ㅤㅤThe main reason is because I'm working on new features, worlds, or working on fixing previous bugs. This is extreamly WIP (Work In Progress) and I'm not that good at coding.</p>

<h1>How can I (you) help!</h1>

<p>ㅤㅤYour feedback is key to the success of this! Also, just testing this is good enough for me. IF your an A-Frame developer, and you want to post a world on this, let me know at E-Mail (pebblecatstudios@gmail.com) or Discord (PebbleCat) [Links Below]. If you also know how to use Networked-aframe, you'd be a big help if you could help me with some stuff.</p>

<h1>Did you create everything?</h1>

<p>As I wish I did, mostly no. I used assets from the internet and each world should have an easy-to-find credits button witch includes full credits to all assets I used. Sence world #00002 is WIP, their isnt a credits page on that, but will be implamented soon. What I did make is the UI and the Buttions that is a text box in a blue box outlined in cyan. :3</p>
